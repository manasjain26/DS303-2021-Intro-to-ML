Steps to run code:


1. Download the datasets from Kaggle and the google drive link and upload on Google Colab.(links given in the presentations also).


Link: https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification
Download the file named: 'features_3_sec.csv'. Directly upload it on Google colab and check the path to add in the code. This data has also been uploaded to our submitted zip file.


Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12mCgkvbmissLh2Vop0bp_t98G8QCaV1E/view
(This data will have to be 'added to drive' and the drive mounted. The location of this drive link has to be written in the code.  


2. Suitably change the path in (pd.read) the .ipynb files. Preferably run all the models on Google Colab.

3. SVM, K-NN and CNN models have been implemented in svm_knn_cnn.ipynb on the GTZAN dataset. The Confusion Matrix of CNN model gets downloaded as a png file on running this code. (you can see this in the files tab in google colab)


4. FFNN model has been implemented in ffnn.ipynb on the Kaggle dataset.
